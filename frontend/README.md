# 🤖 Chat with AI - Your Friendly AI Chat Interface

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to our super cool AI chat interface. This is where the magic happens - you can chat with an AI that actually gets your mood! 

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- Node.js (version 18 or higher) - the engine that powers our app
- npm (comes with Node.js) - our package manager
- The backend API running at `http://localhost:8000` - our AI's brain

### Let's Get This Party Started! 🎉

1. First, let's get all our dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Fire up the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - you're in for a treat! 🎯

## ✨ What's Inside?

Our app is packed with awesome features:
- 🎭 "My Mood" field - tell the AI how you're feeling
- 💭 "My Question" field - ask anything you want
- 🔑 Secure API Key input - your secret key stays safe
- ⚡ Real-time streaming responses - watch the AI think in real-time
- 🔄 Easy navigation with a back button
- 📱 Looks great on any device (thanks, Tailwind CSS!)

## 🛠️ Built With

We used some pretty cool tech to make this happen:
- Next.js 14 - for a super fast, modern web app
- TypeScript - to keep our code clean and bug-free
- Tailwind CSS - for that sleek, modern look
- React Hooks - for smooth, interactive features

## 🔌 API Integration

Our frontend chats with the backend API at `http://localhost:8000/api/chat`. Just make sure the backend is running before you start chatting!

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to tweak the UI to match your style! The components are in `src/components` and the pages are in `src/app`. Go wild! 🎨

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Check if the backend is running
2. Make sure your API key is correct
3. Check the browser console for any error messages

Happy chatting! 🎉
